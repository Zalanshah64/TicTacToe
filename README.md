# Tic-Tac-Toe

A webpage that allows the user to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game played accross the world. Two players play at a 3x3 board of empty squares.
One player goes first, and marks one of the nine squares with an "X".
The second player goes next, and marks one of the remaining squares with an "O".
The players repeat this until either one of the players has three of their symbol in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until every square in the board has been taken.
If a player achieves a three in a row, they have won the game. If the board fills up first, the game is declared a draw.
